Show activity on this post. I am little new to javascript and I am having alittle trouble wrapping my head around making a 2d (or maybe i might need a 3d) array in javascript. I currently have 2 pieces of information i need to collect: an ID and a value so I created the following: var myArray = [];

var id = 12;
var value = 44;

myArray[id]=value; But I realized that this is not easy to loop through the array like a for loop so i was thinking of this: myArray[myArray.length] = id;
myArray[myArray.length-1][id]=value; I wanted to do this so that in a for loop i could get the ids and the values easily but the above only returns the value when i loop through it. Any suggestions on how to get this working or is there a better way to do this?

Are you trying to store a bunch of (id, value) pairs? Do you need to retrieve the value by id at a later time or just iterate through the pairs? – takteek Mar 3 '12 at 4:49 @takteek iterate through the pairs so I want to access both the value and id at element 0 – user1219627 Mar 3 '12 at 4:57 add a comment | 3 Answers 3 Active Oldest Votes This answer is useful 15 This answer is not useful Say thanks for this answer. 0 0 others reacted with thanks.

var myElement = {
  id: 12,
  value: 44
}

myArray[0] = myElement; You could then loop through all of the elements in myArray like so: var i = 0,
    el;

while (el = myArray[i++]) {
  alert(el.id + '=' + el.value);

I think what you want is a dictionary like structure (in JS it's called an object), eg { id => value} In JS you can do something like this: var myDict = { 'myId' : 'myValue' };
myDict[12] = 44; // from your example and this will be added to myDict
myDict[11] = 54;

for (var key in myDict) {
  console.log('key: ' + key + ', value: ' + myDict[key]);
}​ The output will be: key: 11, value: 54 key: 12, value: 44 key: myId, value: myValue share Share a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 3.0 | improve this answer | follow Follow this answer to receive notifications | answered Mar 3 '12 at 5:10 snjoetwsnjoetw 39911 silver badge77 bronze badges add a comment | This answer is useful 0 This answer is not useful Say thanks for this answer. 0 0 others reacted with thanks.

To loop trough is not that hard, you can verify the length of the array, when you reach the end of one dimension e.g. z increase the y by one and reset z to 0. Exemple constructor of 2d-array: function Array2d(x,y){

    var array = new Array(x);

    while(x>0){
        array[x]=new Array(y);
        x--;
    }

    return array;
} to create a 2d array you can use like this: var myMatrix = Array2d(4,4); this is generate a empty 4x4 matrix myMatrix[4][4] (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0)
(0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1)
(0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2)
(0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) to do a 3D or more dimensions just put other loop inside the loop. note: I not tested this function, this is just a algorithm, you should verify the input, if you insert a negative length or float this is probably crash you browser. share Share a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 3.0 | improve this answer | follow Follow this answer to receive notifications | answered Mar 3 '12 at 5:08 Vitim.usVitim.us 14.3k99 gold badges7272 silver badges9393 bronze badges add a comment | Your Answer Thanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!
