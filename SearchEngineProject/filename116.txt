FIFA World Cup Final France celebrating after their win against Croatia in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final Founded 1930; 90 years ago (1930) Region International (FIFA) Number of teams 32 Current champions France (2nd title) Most successful team(s) Brazil (5 titles) The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place organised every four years, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to World War II. The 2018 FIFA World Cup, hosted by Russia, was won by France, which beat Croatia 4–2 in regulation time. The World Cup final match is the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is declared world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is then decided by a penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions.[1] The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2–1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of the tournament) that put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup.[2] In the 21 tournaments held, 79 nations have appeared at least once. Of these, 13 have made it to the final match, and eight have won.[n 1] With five titles, Brazil is the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have participated in every World Cup finals tournament.[4] Italy and Germany (the later having three as West Germany) have four titles. Current champion France, along with past champions Uruguay and Argentina, have two titles each, while England and Spain have one each. The team that wins the finals receive the FIFA World Cup Trophy, and their name is engraved on the bottom side of the trophy.[5] The 1970 and 1994, along with the 1986, 1990, and 2014 games are to date the only matches competed by the same teams (Brazil–Italy and Argentina–Germany respectively). As of 2018, the 1934 final[n 2] remains the latest final to have been between two teams playing their first final. The final match of the most recent tournament in Russia took place at the country's biggest sports complex, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.[6] The 1930 and the 1966 games are the only ones that did not take place on a Sunday. The former did on a Wednesday and the latter on a Saturday. As of 2018, only nations from Europe and South America have competed in a World Cup final. Six nations have won the final as host: Uruguay, Italy, England, Germany, Argentina, and France. Two nations have lost the final as host: Brazil and Sweden.
