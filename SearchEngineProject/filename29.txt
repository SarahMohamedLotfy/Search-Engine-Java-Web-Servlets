Pseudo-polynomial Algorithms NP-Completeness | Set 1 (Introduction) A Time Complexity Question Time Complexity of building a heap Applications of Heap Data Structure Why is Binary Heap Preferred over BST for Priority Queue? Binomial Heap Fibonacci Heap | Set 1 (Introduction) Minimize the maximum difference between adjacent elements in an array Expected Number of Trials to get N Consecutive Heads Design a data structure that supports insert, delete, getRandom in O(1) with duplicates Shortest Palindromic Substring Longest Palindrome in a String formed by concatenating its prefix and suffix Generate an array of given size with equal count and sum of odd and even numbers Paranthesis Theorem XOR of elements in a given range with updates using Fenwick Tree Number of ways to place two queens on a N*N chess-board Find intersection of intervals given by two lists Count of subarrays of size K which is a permutation of numbers from 1 to K Find a N-digit number such that it is not divisible by any of its digits Find and Count total factors of co-prime A or B in a given range 1 to N Number of ways to color N-K blocks using given operation Maximum length Subsequence with alternating sign and maximum Sum Count of elements which form a loop in an Array according to given constraints Difference between NP hard and NP complete problem Sum and Product of all even digit sum Nodes of a Singly Linked List Nodes with prime degree in an undirected Graph Create an array such that XOR of subarrays of length K is X Minimum sprinklers required to water a rectangular park A Time Complexity Question What is the time complexity of following function fun()? Assume that log(x) returns log value in base 2. filter_none edit close play_arrow link brightness_4 code void fun() { int i, j; for (i=1; i<=n; i++) for (j=1; j<=log(i); j++) printf("GeeksforGeeks"); } chevron_right filter_none Time Complexity of the above function can be written as Θ(log 1) + Θ(log 2) + Θ(log 3) + . . . . + Θ(log n) which is Θ (log n!) Order of growth of ‘log n!’ and ‘n log n’ is same for large values of n, i.e., Θ (log n!) = Θ(n log n). So time complexity of fun() is Θ(n log n). The expression Θ(log n!) = Θ(n log n) can be easily derived from following Stirling’s approximation (or Stirling’s formula).       log n! = n log n - n + O(log(n)) Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.
