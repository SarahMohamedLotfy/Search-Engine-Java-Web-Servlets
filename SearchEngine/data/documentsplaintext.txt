featured article The Chestnuts Long Barrow is a chambered tomb located near the village of Addington in the south-eastern English county of Kent. Constructed during Britain's Early Neolithic period, it belongs to a regional style of barrows produced in the vicinity of the River Medway. The long barrows built in this area are now known as the Medway Megaliths. Chestnuts Long Barrow lies near both Addington Long Barrow and Coldrum Long Barrow on the western side of the river, and was built on land previously inhabited in the Mesolithic period. It consisted of an earthen mound, estimated to have been 15 metres (50 feet) in length, with a chamber built from sarsen megaliths on its eastern end. Human remains placed within this chamber during the Neolithic period were found alongside pottery sherds, stone arrow heads, and a clay pendant. The mound gradually eroded away and was gone by the twentieth century, leaving only the ruined stone chamber. (Full article...)
